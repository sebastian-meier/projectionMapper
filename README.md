# projectionMapper
Java Framework for 3D projection mapping (primarily build for processing)

## Important Note:
This is a project i did in 2010, it was one of my first java projects and i haven't touched it since, this repo is for documentation purpose only. The libraries included in this repo are from back then and nothing has been tested with recent versions of processing or java or anything else.

## Info
The idea was simple, you have a 3d object and you want to project something onto the object with multiple projectors. Instead of creating a complex 3d model of the object, we build a mapping tool that allows you to map the object with polygons, you can then in a second step you equalize the shapes. This mapping allows you later on to simply use easy 2d drawing methods which are then mapped onto the 3d object.

Here are some results from our workshop:
